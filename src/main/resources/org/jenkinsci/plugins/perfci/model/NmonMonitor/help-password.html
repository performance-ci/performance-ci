<p>To use SSH public key authentication,
    you should make sure that your Jenkins slave can log into your monitored host by public key authentication.</p>
<p>
    To enable public key authentication, execute following commands on your Jenkins slave:
</p>
<code><pre>
    # If you don't have a SSH key pair, create one. Ignore this command otherwise.
    ssh-keygen

    # copy your public key to monitored host:
    ssh-copy-id &lt;username&gt;@&lt;monitored_host&gt;
</pre></code>
